Database managing approach: Code First

packages needed for the setup:
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

First, set up your database connection in your appsettings.development.json (comments will help in the AppDb.cs)

Steps for creating the connection between the backend and db:

1 - create a db model in Database/Models

2 - map the model in the bottom of the AppDb.cs like this:
	public DbSet<{{YOUR MODEL NAME}}> {{YOUR WANNABE TABLE NAME}} { get; set; }

3 - in your package manager console, step in the dir Backend (in my case thats D:\Stuff\rentyourhome\Backend)
	
4 - run the following command: add-migration "{{YOUR-MIGRATION-NAME}}"

5 - run the following command: update-database


The database table with the proper fields should be created. If any model have to change, run the process from step 3.
